## Known Issues

There are a number of known issues and changes required to the official OpenAPI spec to generate useful client
libraries.

These are all codified in `update-spec.py` which can be used to obtain the latest OpenAPI Specification from a running
Sonatype IQ Server, apply the required modifications and transform from JSON to YAML - outputting the result
to `spec/openapi.yml`.

See `update-spec.py` for amendments made to the Specification prior to client generation.

## Getting the latest OpenAPI Schema

Get it from your Sonatype Nexus Repository Server at `/service/rest/swagger.json`.

## Generation of API Clients

```
docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli batch --clean /local/typescript.yaml

docker run --rm -v "$(PWD):/local" openapitools/openapi-generator-cli generate -i /local/spec/openapi.yaml -g typescript-fetch -o /local/out/test -c /local/openapi-config.yaml -v > out.log
```

## Diagnosing Responses that are not Schema Compliant

In the rare event that Sonatype Nexus Repository Server provides a response that does not validate against the schema (our patched schema to be clear), things can be silent - you just never get a response in your code.

Through the use of [Postman](https://www.postman.com) and [opeapi-request-response-validation](https://github.com/gcatanese/openapi-request-response-validation) project by [Beppe Catanese](https://github.com/gcatanese), we can quickly and accurately see where response validation failures occur.

1. Configure the request for which you are not getting a response in Postman exactly as it was sent
2. To that request (you can do this in a Collection if you are using Collections too), add a Test with the code:

    ```
     // define object
     openapiRequestResponseValidation = {
     // define function
     validate: function(pm) {

         const postRequest = {
             url: 'http://localhost:8080/validate',
             method: 'POST',
             header: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
             body: {
             mode: 'raw',
             raw: JSON.stringify({
                 method: pm.request.method,
                 path: pm.request.url.getPath(),
                 headers: pm.request.headers,
                 requestAsJson: (pm.request.body != "") ? pm.request.body.raw : null,
                 responseAsJson: pm.response.text(),
                 statusCode: pm.response.code
                 })
             }
         };

         pm.sendRequest(postRequest, (error, response) => {
             if(error != undefined) {
                 pm.expect.fail('Unexpected error ' + error);
             } else {
                 var data = response.json();

                 if(data.valid == false) {
                     console.log(data.errors);
                 }

                 pm.test("OpenAPI validation", () => {
                     pm.expect(data.valid, "Invalid request/response (check Console)").to.equal(true);
                 });

             }
         });
       }
     };

     // invoke function
     openapiRequestResponseValidation.validate(pm);
    ```

3. Start the `openapi-request-response-validation` Container locally:
    ```
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ./spec:/openapi -it --rm gcatanese/openapi-request-response-validation
    ```
4. Execute the request in Postman - if the test does not show as passed then you can get details of the failure from two places:
    1. The Postman console
    2. The logs from the running Container

## Changelog

See our [Change Log](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Releasing

We aim to keep the MAJOR and MINOR version component in-line with the version of Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager for which the API Client is
generated - i.e. `3.67.x` are all releases generated for the API specification as shipped with Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager version `3.67.x`.

For example, to perform a "patch" release, add a commit to `main` with a comment like below. The `fix: ` prefix matters.

```
fix: the problem resolved goes here
```

## The Fine Print

Remember:

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours to the open source
community (read: you!)

-   Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
-   Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to `nexus-repo-api-client`
-   DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all - have fun!
